# DSC1010Data

This is a collection of data files first compiled by Dr. Glenn Acree, formerly of Belmont University. Dr. Acree designed the first offerings
of DSC 1010: Introduction to Data Science at Belmont.

The data files in this repository are:
* `beers.csv`, a database of craft beer from [Jean-NicholasHould on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans)
* `books.csv` and `books.xlsx`, a database of books collected from Goodreads by Kaggle user Sournik. Note: At this time, I don't know the differences between `books.csv` and `books.xlsx`; Dr. Acree's notes indicate there may be some data cleaning in creating `books.xlsx` from `books.csv`.
* `netflix_titles.csv`, taken from [Neflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) on Kaggle, collected by Shivam Bansal.
* `HumanFreedomIndex_2018.csv`, taken from [The Human Freedom Index](https://www.kaggle.com/gsutters/the-human-freedom-index) on Kaggle, collected by Guillermina Sutter Schneider.
